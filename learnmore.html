			<p class="section-body scp white-90  fs-20 text-left">
				Our hackathon is a 10-day event where you can dive into coding, learn new skills, and work
				on an
				exciting project with a like-minded team. This is your chance to unleash your creativity and coding
				skills from the comfort of your own home. Starting on August 2, we'll kick things off by
				announcing the theme. You'll then have ten days to brainstorm, design, and develop a project
				that fits the theme.

			<p class="section-body scp white-90  fs-20 text-left">
				This event is all about pushing your limits, trying new things, having fun and
				learning while doing it. Whether you want to build a game, an app, or a new tool, the sky is the
				limit!
