				What's the Deal?
			</summary>
			<p class="section-body scp white-90  fs-20 text-left">
				Our hackathon is a 7-day online event where you can dive into coding, learn new skills, and work
				on an exciting project with a like-minded team or alone. This is your chance to unleash your creativity
				and coding skills from the comfort of your own home. Starting on August 9, we'll kick things off by
				announcing the theme. You'll then have 7 days to brainstorm, design, and develop a project that fits
				the theme.
			</p>
			<p class="section-body scp white-90  fs-20 text-left">
				This event is all about pushing your limits, trying new things, having fun and
				learning while doing it. Whether you want to build a game, an app, or a new tool, the sky is the
				limit!
			</p>
			<h6 class="section-subtitle scp white-90 font-bold fs-20 text-left">Here is how it goes:</h6>
			<ul class="section-list">
				<li class="list-item scp white-90  fs-20 text-left">
					Registration: On July 30, we will open registration, and you'll be able to sign up
					for the event. Registration will be kept open until the hackathon ends.
				</li>
				<li class="list-item scp white-90  fs-20 text-left">
					Theme Announcement: On August 9, we'll reveal the hackathon theme, which will guide your
					project development.
				</li>
				<li class="list-item scp white-90  fs-20 text-left">

				</li>
				<li class="list-item scp white-90  fs-20 text-left">

				</li>
				<li class="list-item scp white-90  fs-20 text-left">
					Results: Projects will be judged based on their alignment with the theme, originality and
