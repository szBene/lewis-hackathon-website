			<p class="section-body scp white-90  fs-20 text-left">
				Our hackathon is a 7-day event where you can dive into coding, learn new skills, and work
				on an exciting project with a like-minded team. This is your chance to unleash your creativity and
				coding skills from the comfort of your own home. Starting on August 9, we'll kick things off by
				announcing the theme. You'll then have 7 days to brainstorm, design, and develop a project that fits
				the theme.
			</p>
			<p class="section-body scp white-90  fs-20 text-left">
				This event is all about pushing your limits, trying new things, having fun and
				learning while doing it. Whether you want to build a game, an app, or a new tool, the sky is the
				limit!
			</p>
			<h6 class="section-subtitle scp white-90 font-bold fs-20 text-left">Here is how it goes:</h6>
