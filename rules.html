					All of your code, designs, and custom assets must be created during the hackathon.
				</li>
				<li class="list-item scp white-90  fs-20 text-left">
					Utilization of third-party libraries and services as a part of your project's functionality is
					allowed, as long as they are available to other participants and do not require any form of
					payment information (e.g. credit card for free trial).
				</li>
				<li class="list-item scp white-90  fs-20 text-left">
					Your project must align with the theme of the hackathon.
				</li>
				<li class="list-item scp white-90  fs-20 text-left">
					You own your project, all the code you write, all the designs and assets you create, but by
					submitting, you allow us to showcase and promote it.
				</li>
				<li class="list-item scp white-90  fs-20 text-left">
					Web applications are encouraged, although all kinds of entries are welcome. If your project requires
					setup, you must provide a clear and detailed setup guide.

					All your work must be open-sourced on GitHub or an alternative, freely available online VCS
					platform.
				</li>
				<li class="list-item scp white-90  fs-20 text-left">
					You must include presentable screenshots of your project along with an optional (but recommended)
					demo video, showcasing its features. A detailed, straight forward setup guide or install script is
					also required if the project is not click-and-run.
				</li>
				<li class="list-item scp white-90  fs-20 text-left">
					Submit your project by the deadline; we will provide a separate submission form closer to the end
					date. Any submissions made after the deadline will NOT be evaluated and only the latest submission
					will be considered. We recommend to create a release,
					tag or branch (e.g. "Submission") in your repository, that you link in the submission form. For
					clarity, name this submission "Hackathon Submission".
